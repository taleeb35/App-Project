# Pharmacy Management System - Project Status

## Overview
This is a comprehensive Pharmacy Management System built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase, designed to manage clinics, vendors, patients, prescriptions, and generate detailed reports.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Design ✓
**Status:** COMPLETE

A comprehensive database schema has been created with the following tables:

#### Core Tables:
- **clinics** - Store clinic information with contact details, codes, and locations
- **vendors** - Store vendor information, contracts, and relationships
- **patients** - Store patient records with demographics and insurance info
- **prescriptions** - Track medication prescriptions linked to patients, clinics, and vendors
- **employees** - Store employee information with role-based permissions
- **vendor_reports** - Track uploaded vendor reports and their processing status
- **exceptions** - Manage data discrepancies and issues with workflow tracking
- **notifications** - System notifications and alerts for users
- **audit_logs** - Complete audit trail of all system activities

#### Junction Tables:
- **clinic_vendors** - Many-to-many relationships between clinics and vendors

#### Security Features:
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on ALL tables
- ✅ Role-based access control policies (admin, manager, staff, viewer)
- ✅ Restrictive policies - data only accessible to authorized users
- ✅ Audit logging for compliance and tracking

#### Custom Enums:
- `user_role`: admin | manager | staff | viewer
- `exception_status`: pending | in_review | resolved | dismissed
- `notification_type`: info | warning | error | success
- `report_status`: pending | processing | completed | failed

### 2. TypeScript Types ✓
**Status:** COMPLETE

- ✅ Complete TypeScript type definitions generated from database schema
- ✅ Type-safe database operations
- ✅ Auto-completion support in IDE
- ✅ Compile-time type checking

### 3. Build System ✓
**Status:** COMPLETE

- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ No compilation errors
- ✅ Vite configured and optimized

## 🗄️ Database Schema Details

### Table Relationships
```
clinics ──┬── patients
          ├── prescriptions
          └── clinic_vendors ── vendors

vendors ──┬── prescriptions
          ├── vendor_reports
          └── clinic_vendors ── clinics

patients ─── prescriptions

employees ── users (auth.users)

exceptions ── employees (assignment)

notifications ── users (auth.users)

audit_logs ── users (auth.users)
```

### Key Features
1. **Audit Trail**: Every action is logged in audit_logs table
2. **Soft Deletes**: Status fields allow soft deletion
3. **Timestamps**: All tables have created_at and updated_at
4. **Referential Integrity**: Foreign keys maintain data consistency
5. **Indexes**: Optimized queries with strategic indexes
6. **Triggers**: Automatic updated_at timestamp updates

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

#### Clinics & Vendors
- All authenticated users can view
- Only admin and managers can insert/update
- Only admins can delete

#### Patients & Prescriptions
- All authenticated users can view
- Staff and above can insert/update
- Only admins can delete

#### Employees
- All authenticated users can view
- Only admins can insert/update/delete

#### Exceptions
- All authenticated users can view
- Staff and above can create/update

#### Notifications
- Users can only view their own notifications
- System can create notifications for users
- Users can update/delete their own notifications

#### Audit Logs
- Only admins can view audit logs
- System can create logs automatically
